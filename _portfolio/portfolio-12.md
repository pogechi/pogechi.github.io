While in California for an IDTechEx conference, I had the chance to meet again with some ELEEP Alumni. This picture was taken somewhere in the Napa Valley where I attended a one-day event on local energy initiatives. On the same year, I got to spend almost a month in the Bay Area, visiting all battery startups and several EV companies (not Tesla, unfortunately).
