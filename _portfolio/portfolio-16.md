In 2016, I was selected with other 20 people to take part in a free study tour of Texas and its budding renewable energy industry as part of the ELEEP program. It was my first time in the US and I was able to touch first-hand the living contradictions of a great country in terms of renewable energy implementation. I also met a wonderful group of experienced policymakers and actors in the energy space.
