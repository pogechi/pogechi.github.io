CAP-XX (LSE:CPX), a leader in supercapacitors that deliver peak power to support or replace batteries, announced at the IDTechEx Show! Berlin 2018 that it has developed the industryâ€™s first 3V thin, prismatic supercapacitors. The company will deploy its 3V technology first in thin prismatic form to meet demand for small, inexpensive, energy-efficient power solutions for thin wearables, key FOBs and other IoT devices. CAP-XX will then integrate the 3V technology into its larger prismatic supercapacitors, automotive modules and other products for high-energy, high-power applications.

I interviewed the company's CEO Anthony Kongats to learn more about their product. Video by Charbax.
