CAP-XX (LSE:CPX) announced at the IDTechEx Show! Berlin 2018 that it has developed the industryâ€™s first 3V thin, prismatic supercapacitors. The company will deploy its 3V technology first in thin prismatic form to meet demand for small, inexpensive, energy-efficient power solutions for thin wearables, keyfobs, and other IoT devices.

I interviewed the company's CEO Anthony Kongats to learn more about their product. Video by Charbax.
