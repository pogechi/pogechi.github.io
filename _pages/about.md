Ciao! My name is Lorenzo and I have been involved in the Li-ion battery industry in a number of positions since 2009. My expertise stems from nanograms to gigawatt-hours, thanks to a diverse and unconventional career path that has led me from Rome, Italy, to Milan, Italy, via Cambridge (UK), Muenster (DE), Ulm (DE), and Munich (also DE, duh!).

What started as a genuine interest in electrochemistry after an elective course I took at the University of Rome, has turned into a career where I could witness a rather obscure topic of research into one of the main enabling technologies to fight climate change.
