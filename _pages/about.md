Ciao! 

My name is Lorenzo and I have been involved in the Li-ion battery industry in a number of positions since 2009. My expertise stems **from nanograms** of chemicals **to gigawatt-hours** of finished batteries, thanks to a diverse and unconventional career path that has led me from Rome, Italy, to Milan, Italy, via Cambridge (UK), Muenster (DE), Ulm (DE), and Munich (also DE, duh!).

What started as a genuine interest in electrochemistry after taking an elective course at the University of Rome, has turned into a full-fledged career where I witnessed the surge of a rather obscure topic of research into one of the main enabling technologies to fight climate change.

My main motivation to work in the climate tech sector stems from my undying optimism on humanity, and our innate capability to come together in times of need to achieve a common goal. I practice what I preach on a daily basis, and I am convinced more people can be educated on the threats of climate change if all of us lead by example.

I opened this personal website to share interesting articles, op-eds, as well as my own analyses and back-of-the-envelope calculations on topics I find of interest.

I like watching sci-fi and dystopian movies/TV series, as well as carrying out little data science projects using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. I can't say I read many books, but when I get hold of one that resonates with me, I can finish it in a couple of days. I also like to dabble with **Raspberry Pi** and small IoT projects, obviously centered around energy harvesting and air monitoring.

All hobbies aside, I devote most of my spare time to my wonderful wife and our two kids.
